## About

There are two things I love developing with, the first is the SPA framework <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> and the second is the End to End Encryption serverless SDK <a href="https://userbase.com" target="_blank">Userbase</a>. Angular is a great framework for developing web apps and Userbase gives you the tools to build a secure but dynamic, affordable web app without the hastle of worrying about a backend. I built this demo to show how easy it is to set up in Angular with the hopes that our community can build web apps with an amazing secure solution that is Userbase.
